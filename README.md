* [Pediatric Pneumonia Detection](https://github.com/victor-hro/pediatric-pneumonia-diagnosis): Convolutional Neural Network that can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays of pediatric patients and outputs the probability of pneumonia along with a grad-CAM(Class Activation Maps) localizing the areas of the image most indicative of the disease.
* [Fire Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/victor-hro/fire-segmentation): considering the importance of an effective automatic method for semantic fire segmentation, the aim of this paper is to develop and compare two approaches:
  * Mathematical methods and classical computer vision;
  * Neural networks.
* [K-Means Image Segmentation](https://github.com/victor-hro/kmeans-image-segmentation): K-Means clustering algorithm used for image segmentation.
